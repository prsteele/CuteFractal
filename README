This project is built on QT, and so uses qmake to build.

Build instructions
==================

Ultimately we will call `make' to make the project; however, Makefile
is automatically generated as follows.

1. Create QTFractal.pro
  - Run `qmake -project' to generate the .pro file; note that any
    manual changes to QTFractal.pro will be destroyed

2. Generate Makefile
  - Run `qmake QTFractal.pro'

3. Run `make'
