This project is built on QT, and so uses the qmake tool to build. You
will need QT 4.X installed to build the project.

Build instructions
==================

This project is built using make; however, the Makefile is generated
using qmake.

-- Building the Makefiles

Run `qmake QTFractal.pro' to generate all makefiles.

-- Building QTFractal.pro

QTFractal.pro can be created via `qmake -project'; however, this will
destroy modifications (such as this particular directory structure)

-- Building the executables

Run `make all'.

Directory structure
===================

src/
  Contains all source and header files

generated/
  Contains all C++ code generated by QT

debug/
  Contains all object files and the QTFractal binary generated in
  debug mode

release/
  Contains all object files and the QTFractal binary generated in
  release mode

Files in the generated/, debug/, and release/ directories can be
deleted, as they can be generated using `make'.
